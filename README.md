# Web3 site token gate

This is a little project built to make it easy for web3 communities to only allow access to a website if their
wallet content allows them into the community â€” e.g. holds a certain amount of a token or a certain NFT.

The primary use case was to token gate access to certain [Notion](https://notion.so) pages. Token gating writing to a
notion page is a bigger problem to solve (for another day), but if used in partnership with [Super.so](https://super.so) or
[NotionX](https://github.com/NotionX/react-notion-x) this can be used to only allow community members to view a site made 
from a Notion page.

## Example
A simple little example can be found on cv site [here](https://sean-personal-site.super.site/), only wallets with at
least 0.001 ETH can access it.

## How to set up for Notion

### 1. Create the community on guild.xyz

_For the moment we're going to piggy back off the great work done by [agora.space](https://agora.space)_ to create a community.

1. Go to [alpha.guild.xyz](https://alpha.guild.xyz/)
2. Connect your wallet
3. Set up a guild to create your community ![img.png](./readme-pics/img.png)
4. Connect the guild to a discord channel (the discord channel is not required for anything for us, it's just a necessary step for their UI)
5. Set the requirements the allows someone to access the community ![img_1.png](./readme-pics/img_1.png)
6. SUMMON!
7. Keep the tab open or copy and keep the end of the url which contains the guild e.g.
`https://alpha.guild.xyz/notiontokengate` copy `notiontokengate`

### 2. Create a site from notion

There are at least 2 ways to do this:
1. Create a website from a public Notion page using [super.so](https://super.so)'s paid subsctipion (payment required for injecting code)
2. If you are technical then you can use [NotionX Next.js example](https://github.com/NotionX/react-notion-x/tree/master/example) to create your
   own site from a Notion page and host it on something like [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) for free

### 3. Inject the script into the site

### Super.so
1. Once set up on super.so, click on the site -> Code -> `Head`

_You should get to the screen below_

2. Copy the content of the [site injection code](./packages/site-injection-app/site-injection-code.html)
3. Change the `guildUrlName` to match your own (copied above in create the community stage 7)
4. Click back to save
5. TADA!

Now only users who meet the criteria set in the [guild.xyz](https://alpha.guild.xyz) community can access your notion page.


## Development

The project is made of 2 parts:
- A simple little app that is injected in to your site
- An api that ensures only those with confirmed access to a wallet

### Run locally
```bash
make install # I haven't set up yarn workspaces yet
# Run the api locally on http://localhost:3000
make api_start
# In a new tab - build the app locally
make app_build
```

You can then, like above, copy the content of [site injection code](./packages/site-injection-app/site-injection-code.html)
(but uncomment the local development line) into a local running site.
